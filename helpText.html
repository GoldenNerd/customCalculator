  <pre>Digit Keys
Normally, each time a digit key is pressed, the corresponding digit will be added to the right hand side of the digits on display.

Exeption1 - calculator is operating on Mode1 
If digit key is pressed immediately after pressing the equals key, the result on display will be replaced by the key digit pressed. The new digit will signal start of a new calculation. Consequently then digit will be the first of the next operand.

Exeption2 - calculator is operating on Mode2
If digit key is pressed immediately after pressing a binary operator, the new digit will show on the display as the first digit of the next operand.

The following are considered digit keys:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0,  .

Unary Operators 
At any point in time user can press a unary operator key. These unary operators require a single operand. The operand will always be whatever is on the calculator display. 
The result will show on display immediately after pressing the unary operator key.
The following are the unary operators: 
change sign
backspace
1/x
square root
square

Binary operators
To be successful, binary operators require two operands.
The mandatory order (from left to right) is: 
1st operand  operator  2nd operand
The following are considered binary operators:
+  -  x  /  %

MS
The number on display will be saved in a memory container for later retrieval to the display. Anything that is in memory at the time MS is pressed will be overwritten. 

MR
A number previously saved to the memory container will be retrieved and shown on the display. Anything that is on display at the time MR is pressed, will be overwritten.

MC
Number saved in the memory container will be erased and consequently the result will be an empty memory location. 

scissors key
Special mode to chance the format of the number on display. 
Also used to round off numbers to the desired number of decimal places. 

?
Press to enter the calculator help mode.

Operating modes of the calculator

Mode0
Calculator accepts new digits and performs unary operations.

Mode1
operand1, binary Operator key, operand2, equals key
The equals key is pressed after every "operand operator operand" sequence.

Mode3
operand1, binary Operator key, operand2, operator key, ... and so on.
A final result is obtained once the equals key is pressed.
In the meantime, intermediate result is kept in a subtotal container.

Automode
By default, the calculator operates in automode. Meaning that it will switch from one mode to another according to the keys sequence presses of the user.

C
Erase all previously entered values, operators, and results.
Memory container is not affected by this "Clear". Memory can only change using the MS or MC keys.

=
Signals the calculator to complete all pending operations and display a final result.
Note:
If "=" is pressed subsequently, the calculator will enter a "Recycle Mode".

Recycle Mode
Special calculator mode, that allows modifications of a final result on the display. After modified, the altered final result may be used as the first operand of next calculation.
The possible modifications are:
change sign
add digits to the right
backspace rightmost digits one at a time
Aside:
A special icon will display to signal calculator entry to recycle mode.

last operator
The upper left corner will show the last operator that was entered, or  programmatically executed.

display
Rectangular upper area of the calculator. Used to display numbers in process and results.

notifications area
Rectangular area at the bottom of the calculator to display error messages once they occur.

List of errors that calculator detects
- repeat dots
- repeat binary operators
- attempt to divide by zero
- attempt to square root a negative number
- very 1st key pressed was not a number key
- pressing equals key with insufficient entries to complete a binary operation.

recovery from errors 
- Green error means it is possible to recover from the error
- Red error means user has to press Clear key to start the calculation all over again.

GLOSSARY:
final result - 

number - 

digit -  In the context of this calculator app, a digit, as opposed to number is a single character number or a dot. A digit is injected to the calculator when the user presses a digit key. Digit keys are are labeled 0 through 9, plus the dot key. 

number - A number is a group of digits that may or may not include a single dot, or a negative sign. It can also be a single digit, with or without a dot or a sign.
